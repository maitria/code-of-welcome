This is a generic form of the Maitria code of conduct. References to Maitria have been replaced with \-\-\-\-\- so you can easily adapt it for your own organization.

Feel free to adapt it in whatever way works for you. You can also submit issues or pull requests, or otherwise open up discussion about aspects you're thinking about.
